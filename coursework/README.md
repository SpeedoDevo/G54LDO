* Grade: 93 / 100
* Comments:
>## Correct Spreadsheet Model
>Developed a correct linear model for this problem. (7.5)  
>The solver parameter settings are set correctly. (7.5)  
>Produced the correct solution based on the designed model. (7.5)  
>As different requirements are considered in the problem, separate models for each objective were designed and both models are reasonably well connected. There is no particular innovative aspects in the spreadsheet modelling. (3.5)  
>### 26 out of 30
>## Quality of Spreadsheet Model
>The data, decision variables, objective function and constraints are clearly identified. The solution is well presented. (5)  
>The spreadsheet layout and formatting are clear and well presented. (5)  
>It used random points to represent each place and then automatically generate a route map from the solution. (4)  
>It used three functions to detect the out path from a place and then used the VLOOKUP function to determine the corresponding place point. (4)  
>### 18 out of 20
>## Correct and Clear LP-Solve Model
>The linear model and the produced solution are correct. (7.5)  
>Excellent descriptive comments are included to clarify each part of the model. (7.5)  
>The algebraic model corresponds fully to the spreadsheet model. (7.5)  
>Two scripts from the MathProg were generated. One automatically eliminates the subtours (based on the findings from the spreadsheet model) and in the other one the constraints are added manually. Both scripts are solvable in polynomial time and produce the same output. Excellent work, well done. (7.5)  
>### 30 out of 30
>## Quality of Demonstration Video
>Good graphical and sound quality. Well-structured presentation and within the maximum length. (5)  
>Good explanation of both models in Excel and LP-Solve. Clearly explains correspondence between models and solutions. A minor issue is that it missed to explain the solver settings. (4)  
>Good explanation of the own understanding accomplished for the design and solution of the model. (5)  
>It fully explained the specific features included in the spreadsheet model and its usability for detecting subtours and then execute their elimination automatically. (5)  
>### 19 out of 20
